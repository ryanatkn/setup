# setup instructions and resources for my dev environment

This repo has docs, configs, and scripts for setting up my dev environment from scratch.
It's designed for distros with `apt` like Ubuntu for both standalone installations and WSL,
and I'd be happy to take PRs to support other operating systems.

> my bash skills aren't that good! I'd appreciate help improving
> [the script](setup.sh)'s code quality

Required:

- `apt` like Debian and Ubuntu

Optional:

- [fish](https://fishshell.com/), the **f**riendly **i**nteractive **sh**ell
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

## instructions

**1**. install a browser for development
(I like to develop with [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home))

**2**. install a text editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
preferably one with good [Svelte support](https://github.com/sveltejs/language-tools) ‚Äî
see [the `vscode/` directory](vscode) for recommended extensions and more

**3**. download
[this repo's files](https://github.com/ryanatkn/setup/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
and run [`setup.sh`](setup.sh):

```bash
wget https://github.com/ryanatkn/setup/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
unzip main.zip
cd setup-main
bash setup.sh
```

and follow the prompts ‚ö°

> `setup.sh` should be idempotent;
> if you notice a problem running it more than once,
> [bug reports](https://github.com/ryanatkn/setup/issues) are appreciated

**4**. go develop

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourname/someproject
cd someproject
npm i
# then
c . # alias for `code .`
gg # alias for `gro dev`
```
